		<SafeAreaView style={styles.container}>
			<Button title='Show Drawer' onPress={showDrawerFn} />
			{showDrawer && (
				<SlidableDrawer
					onSlideEnd={onSlideEnd}

				</SlidableDrawer>
			)}

## Component Props

Property | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
**onSlideEnd** | Function | This gets called when the drawer finishes closing
**event** | string | Value is either `none` or `close`. When the event is set to `close`, the drawer closes completely
**backdropColor** | string | A regular react native color property value
**drawerHandleColor** | string | A regular react native color property value
**useCustomDrawer** | boolean | When set to `true`, the children of the SlidableDrawer are treated as a replacement of the default drawer. Set this to `true` if you want to display your custom drawer instead. Default value is false, this means the children of the SlidableDrawer are treated as contents of the drawer
**noDrawerHandle** | boolean | Drawer handle isn't displayed if this is set to `true`
**drawerHeight** | number | The value you provide gets multiplied by 100 to set the drawer height to a percentage of the device's window height. Valid values are from 0 to `0` to `1`. Default is `0.45`
**drawerBackgroundColor** | string | A regular react native color property value.
**drawerOpenSpeed** | number | The speed at which the drawer opens (relative to time and friction) when the component renders. Values range from `1` to `5`, `5` being the fastest. Default is `5`.
**children** | React.Element | A react native component/element
